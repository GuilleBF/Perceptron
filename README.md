# Perceptron
This is my implementation of a general classification neural network. It has been generalized to support any number of layers and sizes. In this sense, the perceptron.py can be imported and used as a library on any program.
\\
perceptron.py - Contains the perceptron class and an auxiliar function to read datasets
main.py and dataset.csv - Example on how to use the library to train a network that recognises written digits 0-9 and how to save it and load it later.
